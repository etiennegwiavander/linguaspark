# Separate Authentication Routes Implementation

## Issue
Sign in and sign up forms were both displayed on the same URL (`http://localhost:3000/`) with a toggle button to switch between them. The URL didn't change to reflect which form was being shown, making it confusing for users and not following standard web conventions.

## Solution
Created separate routes for sign in and sign up with proper URL-based navigation.

## Implementation

### 1. Created Sign In Page ✅
**File**: `app/signin/page.tsx`

Dedicated sign-in page at `/signin`:
- Email and password fields
- Sign in button with loading state
- Link to sign up page
- Error handling and display
- Uses Next.js Link for navigation

### 2. Created Sign Up Page ✅
**File**: `app/signup/page.tsx`

Dedicated sign-up page at `/signup`:
- Full name, email, and password fields
- Create account button with loading state
- Link to sign in page
- Success message after account creation
- Auto-redirect to `/signin` after 3 seconds
- Error handling and display

### 3. Updated Auth Wrapper ✅
**File**: `components/auth-wrapper.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed inline `AuthForm` component
- AuthGuard now redirects to `/signin` if not authenticated
- Updated sign-out to redirect to `/signin` instead of `/`
- Session expiry redirects to `/signin`

```typescript
function AuthGuard({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth()
  const supabase = getSupabaseClient()

  useEffect(() => {
    // Redirect to sign in if not authenticated
    if (!loading && !user) {
      window.location.href = '/signin'
    }

    // Re-verify session when page becomes visible
    const handleVisibilityChange = async () => {
      if (document.visibilityState === 'visible' && user) {
        try {
          const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
          if (!session) {
            console.log('[AuthGuard] Session expired, redirecting...')
            window.location.replace('/signin')
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('[AuthGuard] Error verifying session:', error)
        }
      }
    }

    document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange)
    return () => document.removeEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange)
  }, [loading, user])

  if (loading || !user) {
    return <Loader2 />
  }

  return <>{children}</>
}
```

## URL Structure

### Before:
- `/` - Shows sign in OR sign up (toggle button)
- No URL change when switching forms

### After:
- `/signin` - Sign in page only
- `/signup` - Sign up page only
- `/` - Main app (redirects to `/signin` if not authenticated)

## User Flow

### Sign Up Flow:
1. User visits `/signup`
2. Fills in full name, email, password
3. Clicks "Create Account"
4. Success message appears
5. Auto-redirects to `/signin` after 3 seconds
6. User can sign in with new account

### Sign In Flow:
1. User visits `/signin`
2. Fills in email and password
3. Clicks "Sign In"
4. Authenticated and redirected to main app

### Sign Out Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign out"
2. Session cleared
3. Redirected to `/signin`
4. Must sign in again to access app

### Unauthenticated Access:
1. User tries to access `/` or any protected route
2. AuthGuard detects no user
3. Redirects to `/signin`
4. User must sign in to continue

## Navigation Between Forms

### From Sign In to Sign Up:
- Click "Don't have an account? Sign up" link
- URL changes to `/signup`
- Sign up form displayed

### From Sign Up to Sign In:
- Click "Already have an account? Sign in" link
- URL changes to `/signin`
- Sign in form displayed

## Benefits

1. **Clear URLs**: Users can bookmark specific auth pages
2. **Browser History**: Back/forward buttons work correctly
3. **Better UX**: URL reflects current page content
4. **SEO Friendly**: Separate pages for search engines
5. **Standard Convention**: Follows common web patterns
6. **Shareable Links**: Can share direct links to sign in/up
7. **Analytics**: Can track sign in vs sign up page visits separately

## Testing

### Test Sign In Page:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/signin`
2. Should see sign in form
3. URL should be `/signin`
4. Click "Sign up" link
5. Should navigate to `/signup` ✅

### Test Sign Up Page:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/signup`
2. Should see sign up form
3. URL should be `/signup`
4. Click "Sign in" link
5. Should navigate to `/signin` ✅

### Test Sign Up Flow:
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Fill in form and submit
3. Should see success message
4. Wait 3 seconds
5. Should auto-redirect to `/signin` ✅

### Test Protected Routes:
1. Sign out (if signed in)
2. Try to access `/` or any protected route
3. Should redirect to `/signin` ✅

### Test Browser Navigation:
1. Go to `/signin`
2. Click "Sign up" to go to `/signup`
3. Click browser back button
4. Should return to `/signin` ✅

## Files Created

1. `app/signin/page.tsx` - Sign in page
2. `app/signup/page.tsx` - Sign up page

## Files Modified

1. `components/auth-wrapper.tsx` - Removed AuthForm, added redirects

## Technical Details

### Next.js App Router
- Uses Next.js 14 App Router
- Each page is a separate route
- Client components with `"use client"` directive

### Navigation
- Uses Next.js `Link` component for client-side navigation
- Uses `useRouter` for programmatic navigation
- Uses `window.location.replace()` for auth redirects (prevents back button issues)

### State Management
- Each page manages its own form state
- Auth state managed by AuthProvider context
- No shared state between sign in/up pages

### Error Handling
- Each page has its own error state
- Errors displayed in Alert components
- Success messages for sign up confirmation
