## Key Test Features

### Comprehensive Section Coverage
Tests verify markdown stripping in every possible lesson section:
- Warmup questions and instructions
- Vocabulary words, meanings, and examples
- Reading passage paragraphs
- Comprehension questions
- Discussion questions
- Dialogue character names and lines
- Grammar focus, examples, and exercises
- Pronunciation words, IPA, practice sentences, and tips
- Wrap-up questions

### Real-World Scenarios
Tests simulate actual AI-generated content patterns:
- Typical vocabulary entries with bold words and italic definitions
- Reading passages with emphasized key terms
- Dialogue with character names and conversational text
- Grammar explanations with technical terms highlighted

### All Lesson Types
Tests cover all supported lesson types:
- Discussion lessons
- Grammar lessons
- Pronunciation lessons
- Reading lessons (with all sections)

### Edge Case Handling
Tests verify robust error handling:
- Empty strings and null values
- Text without any markdown
- Malformed markdown syntax
- Very long text (1000+ repetitions)
- Unicode characters and emoji

### Export Consistency
Tests ensure PDF and Word exports handle markdown identically:
- Same stripping logic applied
- Special characters preserved consistently
- Complex nested markdown handled uniformly

## Integration with Existing Tests

This test suite complements existing tests:
- `test/strip-markdown.test.ts` - Unit tests for stripMarkdown function
- `test/safe-strip-markdown.test.ts` - Error handling tests
- `test/export-consistency.test.ts` - Export format consistency
- `test/export-markdown-consistency.test.ts` - Markdown consistency verification

## Next Steps

Task 17 is now complete. The remaining tasks are:

- [ ] Task 18: Perform manual testing and validation
- [ ] Task 19: Update documentation

## Verification

All 27 integration tests pass successfully, verifying:
1. ✅ Word export with markdown in all sections
2. ✅ PDF and Word export consistency
3. ✅ Real AI-generated content handling
4. ✅ All lesson types and sections
5. ✅ Edge cases and error handling

The markdown stripping integration is fully tested and verified against all requirements.
