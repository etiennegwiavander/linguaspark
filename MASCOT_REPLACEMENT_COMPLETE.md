# Mascot Replacement Complete

## Summary

Successfully replaced Sparky (lightning bolt) with the new ghost mascot reading a book in the FloatingActionButton component.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Updates

**File: `components/floating-action-button.tsx`**
- Replaced `SparkyMascot` import with `AnimatedMascot` from `animated-mascot-demo`
- Updated mascot size to 60px (as requested)
- Added animation state mapping function

### 2. Animation Mapping

Created `mapToMascotAnimation()` function to convert extraction phases to mascot animations:

| Old State | New Animation | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `analyzing` | `thinking` | Ghost thinking with thought bubbles |
| `extracting`, `cleaning`, `preparing` | `reading` | Ghost focused on reading |
| `loading` | `reading` | Ghost reading during load |
| `success` | `success` | Ghost celebrates with sparkles |
| `error` | `error` | Ghost shows concern |
| `idle`, `hover`, `click`, `dragging` | `idle` | Ghost floating gently |

### 3. Enhanced Blinking

The new mascot features realistic blinking with:
- **Four-phase animation**: closing → closed → opening → open
- **Smooth transitions**: CSS-based with natural easing
- **Contextual timing**: Different blink speeds for different states
- **Realistic movement**: Eyes move slightly as they close

### 4. Mascot Features

**Visual Design:**
- Ghost character reading a book
- Professional and educational theme
- Appropriate for language learning context
- Clean, minimalist design

**Animations:**
- Gentle floating motion (idle)
- Focused reading state (extraction)
- Thinking with thought bubbles (analyzing)
- Celebratory bounce with sparkles (success)
- Concerned sway (error)

### 5. Size Configuration

- Fixed size: **60px** (as requested)
- Scales proportionally with all animations
- Maintains clarity at smaller size
- Touch-friendly for mobile devices

## Benefits Over Sparky

1. **Better Brand Alignment**: Ghost reading a book directly relates to language learning
2. **Professional Appearance**: More suitable for educators and tutors
3. **Subtle Animations**: Less distracting, more functional
4. **Enhanced Blinking**: More realistic and natural eye movements
5. **Contextual States**: Animations clearly communicate task status

## Testing

To test the new mascot:

1. Navigate to any page with the FloatingActionButton
2. Observe the ghost mascot at 60px size
3. Click to extract content and watch state transitions:
   - Idle → Thinking (analyzing)
   - Thinking → Reading (extracting)
   - Reading → Success (complete)
4. Watch for natural blinking during idle state

## Files Modified

- `components/floating-action-button.tsx` - Replaced Sparky with AnimatedMascot
- `components/animated-mascot-demo.tsx` - Enhanced blinking animation

## Files Created

- `app/mascot-demo/page.tsx` - Demo page for testing animations
- `MASCOT_REPLACEMENT_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. Test the mascot in the Chrome extension popup
2. Verify animations work correctly during actual content extraction
3. Adjust eye blink positioning if needed for different sizes
4. Consider adding more contextual animations if needed

## Notes

- The mascot image should be placed at `public/mascot.png`
- All animations are CSS-based for optimal performance
- Blinking is automatic and contextual to the current state
- Size is fixed at 60px for consistency across the application
