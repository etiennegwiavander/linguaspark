# üéØ Contextual Vocabulary - Final Implementation

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Removed Double Quotes**
- ‚ùå Before: `"Europe is very important."`
- ‚úÖ After: `Europe is very important.`

### 2. **Bold Target Vocabulary**
- ‚ùå Before: `Europe is very important.`
- ‚úÖ After: `**Europe** is very important.` (displays as **Europe** is very important.)

### 3. **Contextual & Meaningful Examples**
- ‚ùå Before: Generic sentences like "Europe is very important"
- ‚úÖ After: Context-aware sentences like "**Europe** plays a big role in sports" (for Ryder Cup content)

### 4. **Theme-Based Context**
- ‚úÖ Automatically detects content themes (sports, technology, environment, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Creates examples that relate to the actual source material
- ‚úÖ Maintains educational value for real-world language learning

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced AI Prompts:**
```typescript
const prompt = `Create ${exampleCount} contextual ${level} level sentences using "${word}" related to: ${context}. Make sentences meaningful and relevant to the topic. ${levelGuidance} Format: one sentence per line, no quotes:`
```

### **Bold Formatting:**
```typescript
private boldifyTargetWord(sentence: string, targetWord: string): string {
  const regex = new RegExp(`\\b${targetWord}\\b`, 'gi')
  return sentence.replace(regex, `**${targetWord}**`)
}
```

### **Theme Detection:**
```typescript
const themeKeywords = {
  'sports': ['team', 'game', 'win', 'play', 'match', 'competition', 'tournament', 'cup'],
  'technology': ['AI', 'computer', 'digital', 'software', 'system', 'device'],
  'environment': ['climate', 'nature', 'earth', 'green', 'pollution', 'energy']
}
```

### **Contextual Examples by Level:**
```typescript
// A2 Level (Sports context)
`**Europe** plays a big role in sports.`
`Many people are interested in **Europe**.`
`**Europe** affects how we think about sports.`

// C1 Level (Sports context)  
`**Europe** exemplifies the complex dynamics within sports.`
`The multifaceted nature of **Europe** requires nuanced analysis in sports.`
```

## üé® **Display Enhancement**

### **HTML Rendering for Bold Text:**
```jsx
<span 
  className="text-sm text-slate-700"
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: example.trim().replace(/\*\*(.*?)\*\*/g, '<strong>$1</strong>')
  }}
/>
```

## üìö **Expected Results**

### **A2 Level (Ryder Cup Content):**
```

Examples:

‚Ä¢ Many people are interested in **Europe**.
‚Ä¢ **Europe** affects how we think about sports.

‚Ä¢ **Europe** is becoming more important in sports.
```

### **B2 Level (Climate Change Content):**
```

Definition: "Climate refers to long-term weather patterns and atmospheric conditions in a particular region."
Examples:
‚Ä¢ **Climate** represents a significant development in environment.
‚Ä¢ The implications of **climate** for environment are far-reaching.
‚Ä¢ **Climate** has transformed our understanding of environment.
```
