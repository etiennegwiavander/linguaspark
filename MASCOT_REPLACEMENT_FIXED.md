# Mascot Replacement - Final Fix Complete

## Issue
The previous changes had replaced the component but left "Sparky" references in progress messages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Replacement ✅
- **Import**: Changed from `SparkyMascot` to `AnimatedMascot`
- **Component**: Using `<AnimatedMascot>` with 60px size
- **Animation Mapping**: Created `mapToMascotAnimation()` function

### 2. Progress Messages Updated ✅
Removed all "Sparky" references from user-facing messages:

| Old Message | New Message |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Sparky is starting extraction..." | "Starting extraction..." |
| "Sparky is analyzing the page..." | "Analyzing the page..." |
| "Sparky is extracting content..." | "Extracting content..." |
| "Sparky is cleaning the content..." | "Cleaning the content..." |
| "Sparky is preparing your lesson..." | "Preparing your lesson..." |

### 3. Animation State Updated ✅
- Changed initial animation from `'loading'` to `'reading'` to match new mascot states

## Complete Replacement Summary

### Before:
```tsx
import { SparkyMascot } from '@/components/sparky-mascot';

<SparkyMascot
  animation={state.extractionPhase || state.currentAnimation || 'idle'}
  size={buttonSize * 0.7}
  extractionProgress={state.progress}
/>

progressMessage: 'Sparky is starting extraction...'
```

### After:
```tsx
import { AnimatedMascot } from '@/components/animated-mascot-demo';

<AnimatedMascot
  animation={mapToMascotAnimation(state.extractionPhase || state.currentAnimation || 'idle')}
  size={60}
  imagePath="/mascot.png"
/>

progressMessage: 'Starting extraction...'
```

## Animation Mapping

The `mapToMascotAnimation()` function converts extraction phases to mascot animations:

- `analyzing`, `thinking` → `'thinking'` (ghost with thought bubbles)
- `extracting`, `cleaning`, `preparing`, `loading`, `reading` → `'reading'` (focused reading)
- `success` → `'success'` (celebration with sparkles)
- `error` → `'error'` (concerned expression)
- `idle`, `hover`, `click`, `dragging` → `'idle'` (gentle floating with blinking)

## Verification

✅ No remaining "Sparky" references in code
✅ No remaining `SparkyMascot` imports
✅ All progress messages updated
✅ Mascot size set to 60px
✅ Animation mapping function in place
✅ Enhanced blinking active

## Testing

The FloatingActionButton now uses the new ghost mascot with:
- 60px size
- Smooth blinking animation
- Contextual states during extraction
- Professional, education-focused design

## Files Modified

- `components/floating-action-button.tsx` - Complete mascot replacement

## Next Steps

1. Ensure `public/mascot.png` exists with your ghost image
2. Test the button in the application
3. Verify animations work during content extraction
4. Check that blinking appears natural at 60px size
