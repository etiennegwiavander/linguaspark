# Public Routes Fix - Instructions

## What You've Done ✅
You've successfully moved:
- `app/signin` → `app/(public)/signin`
- `app/signup` → `app/(public)/signup`

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Move the Landing Page
The landing page at `app/page.tsx` also needs to be moved to the public route group:

```powershell
Move-Item -Path "app/page.tsx" -Destination "app/(public)/page.tsx" -Force
```

## How It Works

### Next.js Route Groups
Route groups in Next.js use parentheses `()` in folder names. They:
- Don't affect the URL structure
- Allow you to organize routes logically
- Can have their own layouts

### Our Structure:
```
app/
├── (public)/              # Public routes (no auth required)
│   ├── layout.tsx        # Public layout (no AuthWrapper)
│   ├── page.tsx          # Landing page at "/"
│   ├── signin/
│   │   └── page.tsx      # Sign in at "/signin"
│   └── signup/
│       └── page.tsx      # Sign up at "/signup"
├── layout.tsx            # Root layout (has AuthWrapper)
├── popup/                # Protected route
│   └── page.tsx          # Requires auth
└── library/              # Protected route
    └── page.tsx          # Requires auth
```

### URL Mapping:
- `app/(public)/page.tsx` → `/` (landing page, public)
- `app/(public)/signin/page.tsx` → `/signin` (public)
- `app/(public)/signup/page.tsx` → `/signup` (public)
- `app/popup/page.tsx` → `/popup` (protected)
- `app/library/page.tsx` → `/library` (protected)

## Why This Fixes the Issue

### Before (Broken):
1. All pages wrapped by AuthWrapper in root layout
2. `/signin` and `/signup` get AuthGuard
3. AuthGuard sees no user → redirects to `/signin`
4. `/signin` loads → wrapped by AuthGuard → redirects to `/signin`
5. **Infinite loop!**

### After (Fixed):
1. `(public)` routes use public layout (no AuthWrapper)
2. `/signin` and `/signup` load normally
3. User can sign in
4. After sign in, redirected to `/` (main app)
5. Main app routes protected by AuthWrapper
6. **No loops!**

## Testing After Moving Landing Page

### Test Landing Page:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
2. Should see landing page (not redirect)
3. Should NOT be stuck in loading
4. Click "Launch App" or "Get Started"
5. Should redirect to `/signin` if not authenticated

### Test Sign In:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/signin`
2. Should see sign in form
3. Should NOT be stuck in loading
4. Fill in credentials and sign in
5. Should redirect to `/popup` or main app

### Test Sign Up:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/signup`
2. Should see sign up form
3. Fill in details and create account
4. Should see success message
5. Should redirect to `/signin` after 3 seconds

### Test Protected Routes:
1. Sign out (if signed in)
2. Try to access `/popup` or `/library`
3. Should redirect to `/signin`
4. Sign in
5. Should be able to access protected routes

## Summary

The `(public)` route group allows us to have pages that don't require authentication while keeping the rest of the app protected. This is the standard Next.js pattern for handling public vs protected routes.
