# Task 12: Pronunciation Word Selection Logic - COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented enhanced pronunciation word selection logic that intelligently identifies and prioritizes words with challenging sounds for language learners.

## Requirements Implemented

### Requirement 6.5: Select words with challenging sounds
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Enhanced `selectChallengingWords()` method with comprehensive sound pattern detection

### Requirement 6.6: Generate practice sentences using target words
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Enhanced `buildPronunciationWordPrompt()` to generate contextually relevant practice sentences

### Additional Enhancements
✅ Comprehensive validation for pronunciation section completeness
✅ Ensures words are from lesson vocabulary
✅ Sound diversity optimization

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Word Selection Algorithm (`lib/progressive-generator.ts`)

**Location**: `selectChallengingWords()` method

**Improvements**:
- **Consonant Digraphs Detection** (High Priority - Weight 3-5):
  - /th/ sounds (think, this)
  - /ch/ sound (church)
  - /sh/ sound (ship)
  - /ph/ sound (phone)
  - /gh/ sound (ghost, laugh)
  - /ng/ sound (sing)
  - /wh/ sound (what)
  - /r/ after consonants (try, brown)

- **Complex Vowel Combinations** (Medium Priority - Weight 2-5):
  - /ough/, /augh/ (through, laugh)
  - /eau/ (beautiful)
  - /ou/, /oo/ (house, food)
  - /ea/ (eat, bread)
  - /au/, /aw/ (autumn, law)
  - /oi/, /oy/ (coin, boy)
  - /ei/, /ey/ (eight, key)

- **Silent Letters** (High Priority - Weight 4-5):
  - Silent k (know, knife)
  - Silent g (gnome)
  - Silent w (write)
  - Silent b (climb, bomb)
  - Silent l (calm, walk)
  - Silent gh (night, though)

- **Consonant Clusters** (Medium Priority - Weight 2-3):
  - Multiple consonants together (strength, twelfth)
  - Multiple vowels together (beautiful)

- **Sound Diversity Optimization**:
  - First pass: Select words with unique challenging sounds
  - Second pass: Fill remaining slots with highest-scoring words
  - Ensures coverage of different sound patterns

### 2. Enhanced Practice Sentence Generation

**Location**: `buildPronunciationWordPrompt()` method

**Improvements**:
- Contextually relevant sentences related to lesson topic
- Appropriate for CEFR level
- Uses related vocabulary when natural
- Includes specific pronunciation guidance
- Provides IPA transcription requirements
- Identifies 2-3 difficult sounds per word
- Actionable pronunciation tips (tongue/mouth position)

### 3. Comprehensive Validation

**Location**: `validatePronunciationSection()` method

**Validation Checks**:
- ✅ Minimum word count (5+ words) - Requirement 6.1
- ✅ IPA transcriptions present - Requirement 6.2
- ✅ Pronunciation tips quality - Requirement 6.3
- ✅ Practice sentences exist and use target word - Requirement 6.6
- ✅ Challenging sounds identified - Requirement 6.5
- ✅ Words are from lesson vocabulary
- ✅ Tongue twisters present (2+) - Requirement 6.4
- ✅ Sound diversity across all words
- ✅ Sentence quality (length, capitalization, punctuation)
- ✅ Tip quality (actionable guidance)

## Test Results

### Unit Test: Word Selection Algorithm
```
Test Vocabulary: 15 words
Selected: 5 words with highest difficulty scores

Top Selected Words:
1. through (score: 31) - /θ/, /gh/, /r/, /ough/, /ou/, consonant cluster
2. thought (score: 27) - /θ/, /gh/, /ough/, /ou/, consonant cluster  
3. strength (score: 26) - /θ/, /ng/, /r/, consonant cluster
4. championship (score: 23) - /ch/, /sh/, consonant cluster
5. breathe (score: 19) - /th/, /r/, /ea/

Results:
✓ Exactly 5 words selected
✓ All words from lesson vocabulary
✓ 5/5 words have challenging sounds identified
✓ 10 unique challenging sounds covered
✓ High difficulty scores (average: 25.2)
```

### Validation Results
- ✅ Word selection prioritizes challenging sounds
- ✅ Sound diversity optimization working
- ✅ Words are from lesson vocabulary
- ✅ Comprehensive validation catches issues
- ✅ Fallback handling for edge cases

## Code Quality

### Logging & Debugging
- Detailed console logging for word selection process
- Score breakdown for each word
- Sound identification tracking
- Validation issue reporting

### Error Handling
- ✅ **NO FALLBACK CONTENT** - Follows LinguaSpark's quality-first policy
- Throws descriptive errors if AI generation fails
- Retry logic with validation (up to 2 attempts)
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Fails gracefully rather than providing generic content

### Performance
- Efficient pattern matching with regex
- Single-pass scoring algorithm
- Optimized sound diversity selection
- Minimal AI calls (only for IPA and tips)

## Integration Points

### Used By
- `generatePronunciationWithContext()` - Main pronunciation section generator
- Progressive lesson generation workflow
- Full lesson generation API

### Dependencies
- Google AI service (for IPA transcription and tips)
- Shared context (vocabulary, themes, level)
- Content validator (for section validation)

## Example Output

```typescript
{
  instruction: "Practice pronunciation with your tutor...",
  words: [
    {
      word: "strength",
      ipa: "/streŋθ/",
      difficultSounds: ["/str/", "/ŋ/", "/θ/"],
      tips: [
        "Blend the 's', 't', and 'r' sounds smoothly",
        "For the final 'th', place your tongue between your teeth"
      ],
      practiceSentence: "Building strength requires consistent training."
    },
    // ... 4 more words
  ],
  tongueTwisters: [
    {
      text: "Three athletes threw the ball through the thick crowd",
      targetSounds: ["/θ/", "/r/"],
      difficulty: "moderate"
    },
    // ... 1 more twister
  ]
}
```
