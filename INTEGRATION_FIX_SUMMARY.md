# Phase 1 & Phase 2 Integration Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
Phase 1 (Extraction) changed Chrome storage keys, breaking Phase 2 (Lesson Generation).

## Root Cause
- **Phase 1 stores:** `lessonConfiguration` and `extractedContent`
- **Phase 2 was looking for:** `enhancedContent` (old key)
- **Result:** Enhanced metadata was lost, lesson generation may have failed

## Fix Applied
Updated `components/lesson-generator.tsx` to:
1. Look for correct storage keys (`lessonConfiguration`, `extractedContent`)
2. Map Phase 1 storage structure to expected format
3. Add error handling for storage access
4. Add diagnostic logging throughout the flow

## Files Changed
- ✅ `components/lesson-generator.tsx` - Fixed storage key lookup and added logging

## Testing Required
1. **Extraction Flow:** Click Sparky → Generate Lesson (should work now)
2. **Manual Entry:** Paste text → Generate Lesson (should still work)
3. **Check Console:** Look for `[LessonGenerator]` logs to verify flow

## Expected Outcome
- ✅ Extraction flow works with enhanced metadata
- ✅ Manual entry flow still works without metadata
- ✅ Better error messages and debugging
- ✅ No crashes if storage access fails

## What to Check
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
- `[LessonGenerator] Found lessonConfiguration in storage` ← Good!
- `[LessonGenerator] Generate lesson clicked` ← Flow started
- `[LessonGenerator] API response status: 200` ← Success!
- Any error messages ← Report these if you see them

## If Still Failing
Check console logs and report:
1. The exact error message
2. Which step failed (extraction, validation, API call, etc.)
3. The full console output with `[LessonGenerator]` logs

**Status:** ✅ Fix applied, ready for testing
