# Progress Callback Implementation - Task 4 Complete

## Overview

Task 4 has been successfully implemented. Progress callbacks have been integrated into all section generation methods in the progressive generator, providing real-time progress updates during lesson generation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Progress Callback Infrastructure

**Added to `ProgressiveGeneratorImpl` class:**
- `progressCallback?: ProgressCallback` - Stores the callback function
- `completedSections: string[]` - Tracks which sections have been completed
- `currentLessonType: string` - Stores the lesson type for progress calculation
- `phaseWeights: PhaseWeights` - Stores phase weights for proportional progress

**New method:**
```typescript
setProgressCallback(callback: ProgressCallback | undefined, lessonType: string): void
```
This method must be called before starting generation to set up the progress tracking.

### 2. Progress Reporting in generateSection

The main `generateSection` method now:
1. Reports progress at the **start** of section generation
2. Generates the section content
3. Marks the section as completed
4. Reports progress at the **completion** of section generation

### 3. Progress Reporting in Individual Section Methods

Each section generation method now reports progress at its start:
- ✅ `generateWarmupWithContext` - Reports "Generating warmup questions"
- ✅ `generateVocabularyWithContext` - Reports "Generating vocabulary items"
- ✅ `generateReadingWithContext` - Reports "Generating reading passage"
- ✅ `generateComprehensionWithContext` - Reports "Generating comprehension questions"
- ✅ `generateDiscussionWithContext` - Reports "Generating discussion questions"
- ✅ `generateGrammarWithContext` - Reports "Generating grammar section"
- ✅ `generatePronunciationWithContext` - Reports "Generating pronunciation section"
- ✅ `generateWrapupWithContext` - Reports "Generating wrap-up questions"

### 4. Integration with LessonAIServerGenerator

**Updated `LessonGenerationParams` interface:**
Added optional `onProgress` callback parameter.

**Updated `generateLesson` method:**
Extracts the `onProgress` callback and passes it to `generateMinimalAILesson`.

**Updated `generateMinimalAILesson` method:**
Sets the progress callback on the progressive generator before starting generation.

## Progress Calculation

Progress is calculated proportionally based on:
- **Phase weights** - Each section has a weight (e.g., warmup: 10, reading: 20)
- **Lesson type** - Different lesson types include different sections
- **Completed sections** - Tracks which sections have been completed

The `calculateProgress` method:
1. Determines which sections are active for the lesson type
2. Calculates total weight of active sections
3. Calculates weight of completed sections
4. Returns percentage (0-100)

## Error Handling

The `safeProgressCallback` function wraps all callback invocations:
- Catches and logs any errors thrown by the callback
- Ensures callback failures don't break lesson generation
- Returns gracefully if no callback is provided

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- Progress callback is **optional** - existing code works without changes
- If no callback is provided, generation proceeds normally
- No breaking changes to existing interfaces

## Testing

Created comprehensive unit tests in `test/progress-callback-section-integration.test.ts`:
- ✅ Callback invocation with progress updates
- ✅ Handling undefined callbacks
- ✅ Error handling in callbacks
- ✅ Progress calculation with different lesson types
- ✅ Phase weight configuration
- ✅ Duplicate section handling

All tests pass successfully.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { LessonAIServerGenerator } from './lib/lesson-ai-generator-server'

const generator = new LessonAIServerGenerator()

// Define progress callback
const onProgress = (update) => {
  console.log(`${update.step}: ${update.progress}%`)
}

// Generate lesson with progress tracking
const lesson = await generator.generateLesson({
  sourceText: 'Article content...',
  lessonType: 'discussion',
  studentLevel: 'B1',
  targetLanguage: 'English',
  onProgress // Pass the callback
})
```

## Next Steps

This completes Task 4. The next task (Task 5) will integrate this with the streaming API to send real-time progress events to the frontend.

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 1.2** - System updates progress indicator with specific section being generated
✅ **Requirement 1.3** - System increments progress percentage based on actual completion
✅ **Requirement 2.2** - Generator invokes callback with phase information
✅ **Requirement 2.3** - Generator invokes callback with updated completion percentage

All sub-tasks completed:
- ✅ Add callback invocations at start of each section generation
- ✅ Calculate and report progress percentage for each section
- ✅ Update callbacks on section completion
- ✅ Apply to: warmup, vocabulary, reading, comprehension, discussion, grammar, pronunciation, wrapup
