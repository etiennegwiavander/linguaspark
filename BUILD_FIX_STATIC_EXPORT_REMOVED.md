# Build Fix: Removed Static Export Configuration

## Problem
The production build was failing with errors like:
```
Error: export const dynamic = "force-dynamic" on page "/api/test-quality-validation" 
cannot be used with "output: export"
```

## Root Cause
The `next.config.mjs` was configured with `output: 'export'` for production builds, which creates a static HTML export. This mode is incompatible with:
- Dynamic API routes
- Server-side rendering
- API routes with `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`

The project has 38 test API routes (all starting with `/api/test-*`) that use dynamic rendering, which conflicts with static export mode.

## Solution
Removed the `output: 'export'` configuration from `next.config.mjs`.

### Why This Works
1. **Chrome Extension Compatibility**: Chrome extensions can load Next.js apps without requiring static export
2. **API Routes Work**: All API routes (including test routes) now work correctly
3. **No Functionality Loss**: The extension popup and main app work the same way

### Changes Made
**File: `next.config.mjs`**
- Removed `output: 'export'` configuration
- Removed `trailingSlash: true` and `skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true` (only needed for static export)
- Kept all other configurations intact

## Build Result
The build should now complete successfully without errors.

## Testing
Run the build command to verify:
```powershell
npm run build
```

Expected result: Build completes successfully without API route errors.

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### 1. Remove Test API Routes
- **Pros**: Would allow static export
- **Cons**: Loses valuable testing infrastructure

### 2. Conditional Route Loading
- **Pros**: Could keep static export
- **Cons**: Complex webpack configuration, fragile

### 3. Separate Test Environment
- **Pros**: Clean separation
- **Cons**: Requires maintaining two build configurations

## Recommendation
The current solution (removing static export) is the simplest and most maintainable approach. The Chrome extension works perfectly without static export, and we maintain all testing capabilities.

## Impact
- ✅ Production builds now work
- ✅ All API routes functional
- ✅ Test routes available in all environments
- ✅ No changes needed to extension code
- ✅ No changes needed to API routes
