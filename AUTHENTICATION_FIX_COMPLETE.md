# Authentication Fix - Complete

## The Root Cause

The library was showing "0 of 0 lessons" because **you weren't signed in**.

The diagnostic showed:
```json
{
  "error": "Authentication error",
  "details": "Auth session missing!"
}
```

## What Was Wrong

The `lesson-library.tsx` component was trying to check authentication independently instead of using the existing `AuthWrapper` context. This caused:
1. The component to load even when not authenticated
2. Silent failures when trying to fetch lessons
3. Confusing "Loading lessons..." state

## What I Fixed

### 1. Use AuthWrapper Context
Changed `components/lesson-library.tsx` to use the existing auth context:

**Before:**
```typescript
// Manually checking auth
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
if (!user) {
  setIsAuthenticated(false)
  return
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Use auth context from AuthWrapper
const { user } = useAuth()
```

### 2. Simplified Component Logic
- Removed duplicate `loadLessons` function
- Removed `isAuthenticated` state (not needed)
- Removed "Sign in required" UI (AuthWrapper handles this)
- Added `user` to useEffect dependencies

### 3. Better Logging
- Clearer console messages
- Shows user email when loading
- Better error messages

## How It Works Now

### Authentication Flow:
1. **User visits `/library`**
2. **AuthWrapper checks if signed in**
   - If NO ‚Üí Shows sign-in form
   - If YES ‚Üí Shows library component
3. **Library component loads lessons**
   - Uses `user` from auth context
   - Fetches lessons from database
   - Displays results

### Sign In Process:
1. Visit any page (e.g., `/library` or `/popup`)
2. If not signed in, you'll see a sign-in form
3. Options:
   - **Sign In**: Enter email and password
   - **Sign Up**: Create new account (requires email confirmation)
4. After signing in, you'll see the page content

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Sign In
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/library`
2. You should see a sign-in form
3. Either:
   - **Sign in** with existing account
   - **Sign up** for new account

### Step 2: Verify Library Works
1. After signing in, library should load
2. Console should show:
   ```
   üîç Loading lessons for user: your@email.com
   [LessonService] getLessons called with limit: 100 offset: 0
   [LessonService] Fetching lessons for user: <user-id>
   [LessonService] Successfully fetched X lessons
   ‚úÖ Lessons loaded successfully!
   üìä Number of lessons: X
   ```

### Step 3: Generate a Lesson
1. Go to main page (`/popup`)
2. Generate a lesson
3. Check console for save confirmation
4. Go back to `/library` - lesson should appear

## Sign Up Process

If you don't have an account:

1. Click "Don't have an account? Sign up"
2. Enter:
   - Full Name (optional)
   - Email
   - Password
3. Click "Create Account"
4. **Check your email** for confirmation link
5. Click confirmation link
6. Return to app and sign in

**Note:** Supabase requires email confirmation by default. Check your spam folder if you don't see the email.

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see a sign-in form"
- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check if you're already signed in (check console for user info)

### "Sign up doesn't work"
- Check console for errors
- Verify `.env.local` has correct Supabase keys
- Check Supabase dashboard for email settings
- Make sure email confirmation is enabled

### "I signed in but library still shows 0 lessons"
- This is normal if you haven't generated any lessons yet
- Go to `/popup` and generate your first lesson
- Then check `/library` again

### "Auth session missing" error
- You're not signed in
- Sign in using the form
- If form doesn't appear, check browser console for errors

## Environment Variables

Make sure `.env.local` has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

Restart dev server after changing env vars.

## Database Setup

The AuthWrapper automatically creates tutor profiles when users sign in. No manual setup needed!

When a user signs in:
1. ‚úÖ User record created in `auth.users` (Supabase handles this)
2. ‚úÖ Tutor profile created in `tutors` table (AuthWrapper handles this)
3. ‚úÖ Ready to save lessons!

## What's Next

Now that authentication is fixed:

1. **Sign in** to your app
2. **Generate a lesson** on the main page
3. **Check the library** - your lesson should appear
4. **Test filters** - search, filter by level/type/language
5. **Test actions** - view, delete lessons

Everything should work now!

## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `components/lesson-library.tsx`
   - Use `useAuth()` hook
   - Remove manual auth checking
   - Remove duplicate code
   - Simplify logic

### What Works Now:
- ‚úÖ Sign in/sign up flow
- ‚úÖ Automatic tutor profile creation
