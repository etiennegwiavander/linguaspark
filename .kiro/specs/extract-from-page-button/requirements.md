# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LinguaSpark currently requires users to manually copy and paste content into the "Source Content" field to generate lessons. This feature enhances the user experience by adding a visible "Extract from Page" button that appears on any webpage with content. When clicked, it automatically extracts relevant webpage content and initiates the lesson generation flow, eliminating the manual copy-paste step and providing a seamless content-to-lesson workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visible Extract Button on Webpages

**User Story:** As a language tutor browsing any webpage, I want to see a "Extract from Page" button so that I can quickly generate lessons from the current page content without manual copying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LinguaSpark extension is installed THEN a "Extract from Page" button SHALL appear on all webpages with substantial content
2. WHEN a webpage has less than 200 words of content THEN the button SHALL NOT appear
3. WHEN the button appears THEN it SHALL be positioned in a non-intrusive location that doesn't interfere with page content
4. WHEN the button appears THEN it SHALL be clearly branded as LinguaSpark with recognizable styling
5. WHEN the button appears THEN it SHALL be accessible and meet WCAG guidelines
6. WHEN the user scrolls the page THEN the button SHALL remain visible and accessible

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Content Detection

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want the system to automatically detect if a webpage has suitable content for lesson generation, so that I only see the extract button on relevant pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a webpage THEN the system SHALL detect if the page contains educational content (articles, blogs, news, tutorials)
2. WHEN analyzing a webpage THEN the system SHALL exclude pages with primarily navigation, e-commerce, or multimedia content
3. WHEN analyzing a webpage THEN the system SHALL require a minimum of 200 words of readable text
4. WHEN analyzing a webpage THEN the system SHALL detect the primary language and only show the button for supported languages
5. WHEN analyzing a webpage THEN the system SHALL exclude social media feeds and comment sections from content evaluation

### Requirement 3: One-Click Content Extraction

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want to click the extract button and have the system automatically extract and process the webpage content, so that I can proceed directly to lesson generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extract button is clicked THEN the system SHALL automatically extract clean, relevant content from the webpage
2. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL remove navigation, advertisements, headers, footers, and other non-content elements
3. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL preserve the main article text, headings, and structured content
4. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as title, author, publication date, and source URL
5. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL validate that extracted content meets minimum quality standards for lesson generation
6. WHEN content extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the lesson generation interface with the extracted content

### Requirement 4: Seamless Lesson Generation Integration

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want the extracted content to automatically flow into the existing lesson generation process, so that I can customize lesson type and CEFR level without additional steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is successfully extracted THEN the system SHALL open the LinguaSpark lesson generation interface
2. WHEN the lesson interface opens THEN the extracted content SHALL be pre-populated in the source content field
3. WHEN the lesson interface opens THEN the system SHALL pre-select appropriate lesson type based on content analysis
4. WHEN the lesson interface opens THEN the user SHALL be able to modify lesson type, CEFR level, and other settings
5. WHEN the lesson interface opens THEN the user SHALL be able to edit the extracted content before generation
6. WHEN the user proceeds with lesson generation THEN the system SHALL follow the existing enhanced lesson generation workflow

### Requirement 5: User Feedback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want clear feedback during the extraction process and helpful error messages if extraction fails, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extract button is clicked THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator during content extraction
2. WHEN content extraction is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress feedback to the user
3. WHEN content extraction fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue
4. WHEN content extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative options (manual copy-paste, try again)
5. WHEN extracted content is insufficient THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest manual content selection
6. WHEN extraction is successful THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation before proceeding to lesson generation

### Requirement 6: Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want assurance that the extension only processes content when I explicitly request it and doesn't collect unnecessary data, so that I can use it confidently on any website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is active THEN it SHALL only extract content when the user explicitly clicks the extract button
2. WHEN analyzing pages for button visibility THEN the system SHALL not store or transmit page content
3. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL only process the content necessary for lesson generation
4. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL not store extracted content beyond the lesson generation session
5. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL respect website robots.txt and terms of service
6. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL include proper attribution and source URL in generated lessons

### Requirement 7: Cross-Browser and Device Compatibility

**User Story:** As a language tutor using different browsers and devices, I want the extract button to work consistently across all my browsing environments, so that I can generate lessons regardless of my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome browser THEN the extract button SHALL function with full feature support
2. WHEN using other Chromium-based browsers THEN the extract button SHALL maintain compatibility
3. WHEN using different screen sizes THEN the button SHALL adapt its position and size appropriately
4. WHEN using touch devices THEN the button SHALL be touch-friendly with appropriate sizing
5. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the button SHALL be accessible via keyboard shortcuts
6. WHEN using screen readers THEN the button SHALL provide appropriate accessibility labels and descriptions
