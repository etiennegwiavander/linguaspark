# Content Extraction Robustness Requirements

## Introduction

The content extraction system needs to be more robust to handle Chrome extension context invalidation and other common failure scenarios. Currently, users experience extraction failures when the extension context becomes invalid, leading to a poor user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Extension Context Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want content extraction to work reliably even when the extension context becomes invalid, so that I can consistently extract content from web pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension context becomes invalidated THEN the system SHALL detect this condition and attempt recovery
2. WHEN extension context validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message with recovery instructions
3. WHEN the extension is reloaded THEN existing content scripts SHALL gracefully handle the context change
4. WHEN chrome.runtime becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative extraction methods

### Requirement 2: Robust Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when content extraction fails, so that I know what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content extraction fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information for debugging
3. WHEN extraction fails THEN the system SHALL suggest specific recovery actions to the user
4. WHEN multiple extraction attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide escalated recovery options

### Requirement 3: Fallback Extraction Methods

**User Story:** As a user, I want content extraction to work even when the primary method fails, so that I can still generate lessons from web content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chrome.runtime is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use direct DOM extraction
2. WHEN storage APIs fail THEN the system SHALL use session storage as a fallback
3. WHEN the background script is unavailable THEN the system SHALL open the popup directly
4. WHEN all extension APIs fail THEN the system SHALL provide manual content input options

### Requirement 4: Extension Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle lifecycle events properly, so that users don't experience context invalidation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is reloaded THEN existing content scripts SHALL detect the reload and reinitialize
2. WHEN the service worker becomes inactive THEN the system SHALL reactivate it when needed
3. WHEN extension updates occur THEN the system SHALL handle version transitions gracefully
4. WHEN the extension is disabled and re-enabled THEN the system SHALL restore functionality automatically

### Requirement 5: User Recovery Actions

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear instructions on how to fix extraction problems, so that I can quickly resolve issues and continue working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN context invalidation occurs THEN the system SHALL display a "Reload Extension" button
2. WHEN the extension needs reloading THEN the system SHALL provide direct links to chrome://extensions/
3. WHEN extraction fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL offer alternative extraction methods
4. WHEN all else fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual content input as a last resort

### Requirement 6: Diagnostic Information

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive diagnostic information when extraction fails, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log extension context status
2. WHEN extraction fails THEN the system SHALL record browser version and extension version
3. WHEN context invalidation happens THEN the system SHALL log the sequence of events leading to the failure
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging of all extraction steps
