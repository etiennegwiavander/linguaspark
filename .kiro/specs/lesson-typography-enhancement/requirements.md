4. WHEN the lesson title is displayed THEN it SHALL be prominently positioned at the top of the lesson content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want main lesson section topics to be clearly distinguished from content, so that I can easily navigate through different lesson sections.

3. WHEN instructions appear in different sections THEN they SHALL maintain consistent 15px sizing throughout

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want suggested answers and supplementary information to be subtly presented, so that they don't interfere with the main lesson flow but remain accessible when needed.
