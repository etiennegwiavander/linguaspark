# Design Document: Enhanced AI Lesson Generation Quality

## Overview

This feature enhances the pedagogical quality and effectiveness of AI-generated lesson sections in LinguaSpark. The design focuses on improving six key lesson components: warm-up questions, vocabulary examples, dialogue sections, discussion questions, grammar focus, and pronunciation practice. Each enhancement is tailored to CEFR levels (A1-C1) to ensure appropriate difficulty and learning outcomes. The improvements maintain the AI-first approach while implementing specific prompt engineering strategies and validation rules to ensure consistent, high-quality output that serves language tutors and their students effectively.

### System Components

1. **Level-Specific Prompt Builder**: Constructs prompts tailored to each CEFR level with specific complexity requirements
2. **Enhanced Section Generators**: Specialized generators for each lesson component with quality rules
3. **Quality Validator**: Validates output against requirements (count, complexity, appropriateness)
4. **Pedagogical Rule Engine**: Enforces teaching best practices in generated content
5. **Content Complexity Analyzer**: Ensures vocabulary and structures match CEFR level

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Level-Specific Prompt Builder

**Purpose**: Constructs AI prompts with CEFR-appropriate complexity and quantity specifications

```typescript
interface LevelSpecificPromptBuilder {
  buildWarmupPrompt(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): EnhancedPrompt;
  buildVocabularyPrompt(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): EnhancedPrompt;
  buildDialoguePrompt(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): EnhancedPrompt;
  buildDiscussionPrompt(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): EnhancedPrompt;
  buildGrammarPrompt(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): EnhancedPrompt;
  buildPronunciationPrompt(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): EnhancedPrompt;
}

interface EnhancedPrompt {
  systemPrompt: string;
  userPrompt: string;
  qualityRules: QualityRule[];
  expectedOutput: OutputSpecification;
}

interface OutputSpecification {
  minItems?: number;
  maxItems?: number;
  examplesPerItem?: number;
  complexityLevel: string;
  requiredElements: string[];
}
```

**Design Rationale**: Centralizing prompt construction with level-specific rules ensures consistency and makes it easy to adjust quality standards across all lesson types.

### 2. Enhanced Warm-up Generator

**Purpose**: Generates warm-up questions that activate prior knowledge without assuming content familiarity

```typescript
interface WarmupGenerator {
  generateWarmupQuestions(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): WarmupSection;
  validateWarmupQuality(questions: string[]): ValidationResult;
}

interface WarmupSection {
  questions: string[];
  pedagogicalFocus: string;
  avoidedAssumptions: string[];
}
```

**Design Rationale**: Warm-up questions are critical for lesson engagement. The generator explicitly avoids referencing specific content details and focuses on activating students' personal experiences and general knowledge related to the topic.

**Key Design Decision**: Prompts will explicitly instruct the AI to avoid names, events, and outcomes from the source material, instead focusing on universal themes and personal connections.

### 3. Enhanced Vocabulary Generator

**Purpose**: Generates vocabulary sections with level-appropriate example sentence counts

```typescript
interface VocabularyGenerator {
  generateVocabulary(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): VocabularySection;
  getExampleCountForLevel(level: CEFRLevel): number;
  validateVocabularyQuality(vocab: VocabularyItem[]): ValidationResult;
}

interface VocabularySection {
  items: VocabularyItem[];
  level: CEFRLevel;
  examplesPerWord: number;
}

interface VocabularyItem {
  word: string;
  definition: string;
  examples: string[];
  contextRelevance: string;
}
```

**Design Rationale**: Different CEFR levels require different amounts of practice. Lower levels (A1/A2) need more examples (5) for reinforcement, while higher levels (C1) need fewer (2) as learners can generalize more quickly.

**Level-Specific Rules**:
- A1/A2: 5 examples per word (maximum reinforcement)
- B1: 4 examples per word (moderate reinforcement)
- B2: 3 examples per word (reduced reinforcement)
- C1: 2 examples per word (minimal reinforcement)

### 4. Enhanced Dialogue Generator

**Purpose**: Generates dialogue sections with appropriate length and complexity

```typescript
interface DialogueGenerator {
  generateDialogue(content: string, level: CEFRLevel, type: DialogueType): DialogueSection;
  validateDialogueLength(dialogue: DialogueLine[]): ValidationResult;
  validateDialogueComplexity(dialogue: DialogueLine[], level: CEFRLevel): ValidationResult;
}

interface DialogueSection {
  lines: DialogueLine[];
  type: 'practice' | 'fill-in-gap';
  complexity: ComplexityMetrics;
  vocabularyIntegration: string[];
}

interface DialogueLine {
  speaker: string;
  text: string;
  gap?: string; // For fill-in-gap exercises
}
```

**Design Rationale**: Minimum 12 lines ensures meaningful conversational practice. Complexity varies by level to match learner capabilities.

**Complexity Guidelines**:
- A1/A2: Simple vocabulary, basic sentence structures, present tense focus
- B1: Intermediate vocabulary, varied structures, multiple tenses
- B2/C1: Advanced vocabulary, complex structures, idiomatic expressions

### 5. Enhanced Discussion Generator

**Purpose**: Generates exactly 5 discussion questions with level-appropriate complexity

```typescript
interface DiscussionGenerator {
  generateDiscussionQuestions(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): DiscussionSection;
  validateQuestionComplexity(questions: DiscussionQuestion[], level: CEFRLevel): ValidationResult;
}

interface DiscussionSection {
  questions: DiscussionQuestion[];
  expectedResponseLength: string;
  cognitiveLevel: string;
}

interface DiscussionQuestion {
  question: string;
  questionType: 'factual' | 'opinion' | 'comparison' | 'analytical' | 'evaluative';
  expectedComplexity: string;
}
```

**Design Rationale**: Fixed count of 5 questions provides consistency. Question types progress from simple to complex based on CEFR level.

**Question Type Progression**:
- A1/A2: Factual and simple opinion questions
- B1: Opinion questions and comparisons
- B2/C1: Analytical and evaluative questions

### 6. Enhanced Grammar Generator

**Purpose**: Generates comprehensive grammar sections with explanations and practice

```typescript
interface GrammarGenerator {
  generateGrammarFocus(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): GrammarSection;
  identifyRelevantGrammarPoint(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): GrammarPoint;
  validateGrammarExercises(exercises: Exercise[]): ValidationResult;
}

interface GrammarSection {
  grammarPoint: GrammarPoint;
  explanation: GrammarExplanation;
  examples: string[];
  exercises: Exercise[];
}

interface GrammarExplanation {
  rule: string;
  form: string;
  usage: string;
  levelAppropriate: boolean;
}

interface Exercise {
  prompt: string;
  answer: string;
  explanation?: string;
}
```

**Design Rationale**: Comprehensive grammar sections require both form and usage explanations. Minimum 5 practice items ensures adequate practice. Context-relevant examples improve retention.

### 7. Enhanced Pronunciation Generator

**Purpose**: Generates pronunciation practice with challenging words and tongue twisters

```typescript
interface PronunciationGenerator {
  generatePronunciationPractice(content: string, level: CEFRLevel): PronunciationSection;
  selectChallengingWords(content: string, count: number): string[];
  generateTongueTwisters(content: string, count: number): TongueTwister[];
}

interface PronunciationSection {
  words: PronunciationWord[];
  tongueTwisters: TongueTwister[];
  focusSounds: string[];
}

interface PronunciationWord {
  word: string;
  ipa: string;
  tips: string[];
  practiceSentence: string;
}

interface TongueTwister {
  text: string;
  targetSounds: string[];
  difficulty: string;
}
```

**Design Rationale**: Minimum 5 advanced words and 2 tongue twisters provides substantial pronunciation practice. IPA transcriptions and tips support self-study.

## Data Models

### Enhanced Lesson Generation Request

```typescript
interface EnhancedLessonRequest {
  content: string;
  lessonType: LessonType;
  cefrLevel: CEFRLevel;
  userId: string;
  qualityPreferences?: QualityPreferences;
}

interface QualityPreferences {
  emphasizeVocabulary?: boolean;
  focusOnPronunciation?: boolean;
  grammarIntensity?: 'light' | 'moderate' | 'intensive';
}
```

### Enhanced Lesson Structure

```typescript
interface EnhancedLesson {
  id: string;
  cefrLevel: CEFRLevel;
  sections: {
    warmup: WarmupSection;
    vocabulary: VocabularySection;
    dialogue: DialogueSection;
    discussion: DiscussionSection;
    grammar: GrammarSection;

  warmupQualityScore: number;
  vocabularyExampleCount: number;
  dialogueLineCount: number;
  discussionQuestionCount: number;
  grammarExerciseCount: number;
  pronunciationWordCount: number;
  overallComplexityMatch: boolean;
}
```

### Quality Validation Result

```typescript
interface QualityValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  section: string;
  issues: QualityIssue[];
  suggestions: string[];
}

interface QualityIssue {
  type: 'COUNT_MISMATCH' | 'COMPLEXITY_MISMATCH' | 'CONTENT_ASSUMPTION' | 'MISSING_ELEMENT';
  severity: 'error' | 'warning';
  description: string;
  expectedValue?: any;
  actualValue?: any;
}
```

## Quality Validation and Error Handling

### Quality Validation Strategy

Each generated section undergoes validation before being included in the final lesson:

1. **Count Validation**: Verify correct number of items (questions, examples, dialogue lines)
2. **Complexity Validation**: Ensure vocabulary and structures match CEFR level
3. **Content Validation**: Check for content assumptions in warm-up questions
4. **Completeness Validation**: Verify all required elements are present

### Validation Rules by Section

**Warm-up Questions**:
- Must not reference specific names, events, or outcomes from source
- Must focus on personal experience and general knowledge
- Must be appropriate for CEFR level

**Vocabulary**:
- Must have correct example count for level (A1/A2: 5, B1: 4, B2: 3, C1: 2)
- Examples must be contextually relevant
- Complexity must match CEFR level

**Dialogue**:
- Must have minimum 12 lines
- Complexity must match CEFR level
- Must incorporate lesson vocabulary

**Discussion**:
- Must have exactly 5 questions
- Question types must match CEFR level
- Must relate to source material

**Grammar**:
- Must have minimum 5 practice exercises
- Must include both form and usage explanations
- Examples must be context-relevant

**Pronunciation**:
- Must have minimum 5 advanced words
- Must have minimum 2 tongue twisters
- Must include IPA transcriptions

### Regeneration Strategy

**Design Decision**: If a section fails quality validation, regenerate with adjusted prompts rather than accepting substandard output.

**Rationale**: Maintaining pedagogical quality is essential for tutor trust. Regeneration with more specific prompts typically resolves quality issues on the second attempt.

**Regeneration Limits**: Maximum 2 regeneration attempts per section to prevent infinite loops and excessive API usage.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

   - Test complexity matching for different CEFR levels
   - Test content assumption detection in warm-ups
   - Test completeness validation

3. **Section Generator Tests**
   - Test each enhanced generator independently
   - Verify output format and structure
   - Test level-appropriate content generation

### Integration Testing

## Security and Privacy Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Ensure Google AI API keys remain properly secured during enhanced generation
2. **Content Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize user content before processing with enhanced prompts
3. **Quality Validation Privacy**: Ensure validation logic doesn't log sensitive user content
4. **Prompt Security**: Ensure level-specific prompts don't expose system internals to AI service

## Performance Considerations

1. **Generation Time Targets**:
   - Keep total lesson generation under 45 seconds (increased from baseline due to quality validation)
   - Individual section generation under 8 seconds
   - Quality validation under 1 second per section
   - Regeneration (when needed) adds 8-10 seconds per section

2. **Quality vs Speed Trade-offs**:
   - **Design Decision**: Prioritize quality over speed
   - **Rationale**: Tutors value pedagogically sound lessons over fast generation. An extra 10-15 seconds for quality validation and potential regeneration is acceptable.

3. **Validation Efficiency**:
   - Use lightweight validation rules that don't require additional AI calls
   - Implement fast regex and counting algorithms
   - Cache validation results for identical content

4. **Regeneration Strategy**:
   - Limit to 2 regeneration attempts to prevent excessive delays
   - Use more specific prompts on regeneration to increase success rate
   - Track regeneration frequency to identify problematic sections

1. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Validation pass rate per section type
   - Regeneration frequency per section type
   - Average quality scores per CEFR level
   - Example count accuracy (vocabulary)
   - Line count accuracy (dialogue)
   - Question count accuracy (discussion)

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Generation time per section
   - Validation time per section
   - Total lesson generation time
   - Regeneration overhead

3. **Pedagogical Effectiveness Metrics**:
   - Tutor satisfaction ratings per section type
   - Most frequently regenerated sections
   - CEFR level appropriateness feedback
   - Content assumption detection accuracy (warm-ups)

4. **Alerting**:
   - High regeneration rates (indicates prompt issues)
   - Low validation pass rates (indicates quality problems)
   - Excessive generation times (indicates performance issues)
   - CEFR complexity mismatches (indicates level-targeting problems)
