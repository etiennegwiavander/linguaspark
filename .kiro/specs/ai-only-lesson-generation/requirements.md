# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LinguaSpark's core vision is to use AI to transform any webpage content into language lesson material. This update focuses on enhancing the quality and pedagogical effectiveness of generated lesson sections to better serve language tutors and their students. The enhancements will improve warm-up questions, vocabulary examples, dialogue complexity, discussion questions, grammar focus, and pronunciation practice while maintaining the AI-first approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Warm-up Questions

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want warm-up questions that activate students' prior knowledge without assuming they already know the content, so that students can engage with the topic from their own experience and perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN generating warm-up questions THEN the system SHALL avoid referencing specific events, people, or outcomes from the source material
3. WHEN generating warm-up questions THEN the system SHALL focus on students' personal experiences and general knowledge related to the topic
4. WHEN generating warm-up questions THEN the system SHALL create questions appropriate for the student's CEFR level
5. WHEN generating warm-up questions THEN the system SHALL generate questions that build interest and mental focus for the reading task

### Requirement 2: Level-Appropriate Vocabulary Examples

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want vocabulary sections with the correct number of example sentences for each CEFR level, so that students get appropriate practice and reinforcement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating vocabulary for A1 level THEN the system SHALL provide 5 example sentences per vocabulary word
2. WHEN generating vocabulary for A2 level THEN the system SHALL provide 5 example sentences per vocabulary word
3. WHEN generating vocabulary for B1 level THEN the system SHALL provide 4 example sentences per vocabulary word
4. WHEN generating vocabulary for B2 level THEN the system SHALL provide 3 example sentences per vocabulary word
5. WHEN generating vocabulary for C1 level THEN the system SHALL provide 2 example sentences per vocabulary word
6. WHEN generating example sentences THEN the system SHALL ensure they are contextually relevant to the source material
7. WHEN generating example sentences THEN the system SHALL match the complexity to the student's CEFR level

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Dialogue Sections

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want dialogue practice sections with sufficient length and appropriate complexity, so that students get meaningful conversational practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating dialogue practice THEN the system SHALL create at least 12 dialogue lines
2. WHEN generating dialogue fill-in-the-gap THEN the system SHALL create at least 12 dialogue lines
3. WHEN generating dialogue for A1/A2 levels THEN the system SHALL use simple vocabulary and basic sentence structures
4. WHEN generating dialogue for B1 level THEN the system SHALL use intermediate vocabulary and varied sentence structures
5. WHEN generating dialogue for B2/C1 levels THEN the system SHALL use advanced vocabulary and complex sentence structures
6. WHEN generating dialogue THEN the system SHALL ensure natural conversational flow
7. WHEN generating dialogue THEN the system SHALL incorporate vocabulary from the lesson

### Requirement 4: Expanded Discussion Questions

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want 5 discussion questions with appropriate complexity, so that students can engage in deeper conversation about the topic.

6. WHEN generating discussion questions THEN the system SHALL encourage extended responses appropriate to the level

### Requirement 5: Elaborate Grammar Focus Section

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want a comprehensive grammar section with detailed explanations and practice exercises, so that students can understand and practice the grammar point effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating grammar focus THEN the system SHALL identify a relevant grammar point from the source material
2. WHEN generating grammar focus THEN the system SHALL provide a clear explanation of the grammar rule
3. WHEN generating grammar focus THEN the system SHALL include multiple example sentences demonstrating the grammar point
4. WHEN generating grammar focus THEN the system SHALL provide practice exercises with at least 5 items
5. WHEN generating grammar focus THEN the system SHALL adapt the complexity to the student's CEFR level
6. WHEN generating grammar focus THEN the system SHALL include both form and usage explanations
7. WHEN generating grammar focus THEN the system SHALL provide context-relevant examples from the source material

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Pronunciation Practice
