# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LinguaSpark's core vision is to use AI to transform any webpage content into language lesson material. The current implementation has introduced fallback content mechanisms that compromise this vision by providing generic lessons when AI fails. This feature will remove all fallback content and implement AI optimization strategies to minimize token consumption while maintaining the AI-first approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want the system to only generate lessons using AI from the actual webpage content, so that every lesson is truly derived from the source material and maintains the product's core value proposition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user
2. WHEN AI generation fails THEN the system SHALL NOT provide any fallback or template content
3. WHEN AI generation fails THEN the system SHALL suggest the user try again later
4. WHEN AI generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error for debugging purposes
5. IF the source text is insufficient THEN the system SHALL inform the user before attempting AI generation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want the system to optimize AI token consumption per lesson, so that I can generate more lessons within API quotas and reduce operational costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a lesson THEN the system SHALL use optimized prompts that minimize token usage
2. WHEN generating a lesson THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent prompt batching where possible
3. WHEN generating a lesson THEN the system SHALL cache reusable AI responses for similar content
4. WHEN generating a lesson THEN the system SHALL use progressive generation (generate core sections first, then details)
5. WHEN generating a lesson THEN the system SHALL implement smart content truncation based on lesson requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want clear feedback when AI generation fails, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generation fails due to quota limits THEN the system SHALL display "API quota exceeded, please try again later"
2. WHEN AI generation fails due to content issues THEN the system SHALL display "Unable to process this content, please try different text"
3. WHEN AI generation fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display "Connection error, please check your internet and try again"
4. WHEN AI generation fails for unknown reasons THEN the system SHALL display "AI service temporarily unavailable, please try again later"
5. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL provide actionable next steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a language tutor, I want the system to implement intelligent AI optimization strategies, so that lesson generation is both cost-effective and maintains high quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating vocabulary THEN the system SHALL extract key terms first and only generate definitions for selected words
2. WHEN generating reading passages THEN the system SHALL use content summarization instead of full text processing
3. WHEN generating questions THEN the system SHALL use single-prompt generation for multiple questions
4. WHEN generating dialogue THEN the system SHALL reuse vocabulary and themes from earlier sections
5. WHEN generating lessons THEN the system SHALL implement section-by-section generation with shared context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of AI usage and failures, so that I can monitor system performance and optimize further.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI calls are made THEN the system SHALL log token consumption per section
2. WHEN AI calls fail THEN the system SHALL log the specific error and context
3. WHEN lessons are generated THEN the system SHALL track total tokens used per lesson
4. WHEN optimization strategies are applied THEN the system SHALL log the savings achieved
5. WHEN users encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide error IDs for support tracking
