## Test File

**Location:** `test/section-generators.test.ts`

**Test Framework:** Vitest
**Total Tests:** 44
**Pass Rate:** 100%

## Key Testing Strategies

1. **Validator Testing**: Tests all validators (WarmupValidator, DialogueValidator, DiscussionValidator, GrammarValidator, PronunciationValidator) independently

2. **CEFR Level Testing**: Validates that content complexity matches expected CEFR levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1)

3. **Count Validation**: Ensures correct quantities:
   - 3 warm-up questions
   - 5 discussion questions
   - 12+ dialogue lines
   - 5+ grammar exercises
   - 5+ pronunciation words
   - 2+ tongue twisters
   - Level-specific vocabulary example counts

4. **Quality Validation**: Tests for:
   - Content assumption detection
   - Contextual relevance
   - Vocabulary integration
   - Format correctness
   - Completeness

5. **Error Detection**: Validates that validators correctly identify:
   - Missing required elements
   - Incorrect counts
   - Complexity mismatches
   - Format errors
   - Quality issues

## Running the Tests

```bash
npm test -- test/section-generators.test.ts --run
```

Duration  1.47s
```

## Requirements Validation

All requirements from the specification are validated:

- ✅ **Requirement 1 (Warm-up)**: All 5 acceptance criteria tested
- ✅ **Requirement 2 (Vocabulary)**: All 7 acceptance criteria tested
- ✅ **Requirement 3 (Dialogue)**: All 7 acceptance criteria tested
- ✅ **Requirement 4 (Discussion)**: All 6 acceptance criteria tested
- ✅ **Requirement 5 (Grammar)**: All 7 acceptance criteria tested
- ✅ **Requirement 6 (Pronunciation)**: All 6 acceptance criteria tested

## Next Steps

Task 15 (Integration Tests) can now proceed with confidence that all individual section generators and validators work correctly.

## Notes

- Tests use mocked Google AI service to avoid API calls during testing
- Tests validate both positive cases (valid content) and negative cases (invalid content)
- Tests cover edge cases like missing data, incorrect counts, and complexity mismatches
- All validators return structured results with issues, warnings, and quality scores
