## File Structure

```
app/
  library/
    page.tsx                    # Library route

components/
  lesson-library.tsx            # Main library component
  workspace-sidebar.tsx         # Updated with library link

lib/
  lessons.ts                    # Existing lesson service (used)
```

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Component loads → Fetch all lessons from Supabase
2. User applies filters → Client-side filtering
3. User clicks lesson → Navigate with lesson ID
4. Main page loads lesson data

### Filtering Logic
- All filters are client-side for instant response
- Filters are combinable (AND logic)
- Search uses case-insensitive matching
- Results update in real-time

### Performance
- Loads up to 100 lessons initially
- Client-side filtering (no API calls)
- Efficient re-renders with React state
- Lazy loading can be added later if needed

## Usage

### For Users:
1. Click "Lesson Library" in sidebar
2. Browse all created lessons
3. Use search to find specific lessons
4. Apply filters to narrow results
5. Click lesson to view/edit
6. Delete unwanted lessons

### Filter Examples:
- **Find B1 discussion lessons**: Level=B1, Type=Discussion
- **Find web-sourced lessons**: Source=From Web
- **Find Spanish lessons**: Language=Spanish
- **Search by topic**: Type "climate" in search

## Benefits

### For Tutors:
- **Organization**: All lessons in one place
- **Quick Access**: Find lessons fast with filters
- **Reusability**: Easily reuse past lessons
- **Management**: Delete outdated lessons
- **Overview**: See lesson creation history

### For Workflow:
- **Efficiency**: No need to recreate similar lessons
- **Planning**: Review past lessons for ideas
- **Tracking**: See what levels/types you've covered
- **Quality**: Build a curated library over time

## Future Enhancements
