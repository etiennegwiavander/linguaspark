   - Async operation handling for loading/success/error states

### ✅ Animation States Implemented

| Animation | Trigger | Visual Effects | Duration |
|-----------|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Idle** | Default state | Gentle floating, occasional blinking/winking | Continuous |
| **Hover** | Mouse hover | Excited bouncing, eye sparkles, increased glow | Continuous |
| **Click** | Button click | Quick flash, wink, spark burst | 200ms |
| **Loading** | Content extraction | Spinning with determined expression, orbital sparks | Continuous |
| **Success** | Extraction complete | Celebration bounce, happy eyes, confetti sparks | 2000ms |
| **Error** | Extraction failed | Sad droop, concerned expression, dimmed glow | 1500ms |
| **Dragging** | Button repositioning | Focused expression, trailing sparks, slight tilt | Continuous |
