# Warm-up Questions Debug Fix

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**
The contextual warm-up questions were being generated but not properly preserved in the final lesson structure.

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Preserved Contextual Warm-up in Lesson Structure**
- Modified `generateContextualLessonStructure` to explicitly preserve the generated warm-up questions
- Added `parsed.warmup = contextualWarmup` to ensure AI doesn't override our contextual questions
- Applied this fix to both successful parsing and fallback scenarios

### 2. **Enhanced Fallback Lesson Generation**
- Updated `generateEnhancedFallbackLesson` to use contextual warm-up generation instead of generic templates
- Created mock content analysis for fallback scenarios
- Ensured contextual warm-up questions are used even when AI fails

### 3. **Added Comprehensive Debugging**
- Added detailed console logging throughout the warm-up generation process
- Created test endpoint `/api/test-warmup` to isolate warm-up generation testing
- Added "Test Warm-up Questions" button in development mode

### 4. **Structured Fallback Improvements**
- Modified `createStructuredFallback` to accept contextual warm-up questions from caller
- Ensured all fallback paths use contextual warm-up questions

## 🧪 **Testing Tools Added**

### Test Endpoint: `/api/test-warmup`
Tests warm-up generation with realistic data:
- BBC news article about remote work
- B1 level student
- Discussion lesson type
- Returns generated warm-up questions for inspection

### Development Test Button
- "Test Warm-up Questions" button in lesson generator
- Shows generated questions in alert popup
- Helps verify warm-up generation is working

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### Before (Issue):
```typescript
// AI could override warm-up questions
const parsed = JSON.parse(response)
return parsed // warm-up might be overridden
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// Explicitly preserve contextual warm-up
const parsed = JSON.parse(response)
parsed.warmup = contextualWarmup // Force preservation
console.log("🔥 Preserved contextual warm-up questions")
return parsed
```

## 📊 **Expected Console Output**

When generating lessons, you should now see:
```
🔥 Generating CEFR-adapted warm-up questions...
🤖 Calling AI for contextual warm-up questions...
✅ AI warm-up questions generated
🔥 Parsed warm-up questions: ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]
✅ Final warm-up questions: ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]
🔥 Generated contextual warm-up questions: ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]
🔥 Preserved contextual warm-up questions in final structure
```

## 🎯 **How to Test**

### 1. Test Warm-up Generation Directly
Click "Test Warm-up Questions" button in development mode to see:
- B1 level questions about remote work in the UK
- Questions that reference specific content and cultural context
- CEFR-appropriate complexity

### 2. Generate Full Lesson
Generate a lesson and check browser console for:
- Detailed warm-up generation logs
- Confirmation that contextual questions are preserved
- No fallback to generic templates

### 3. Verify Frontend Display
The lesson display should now show:
- Content-specific warm-up questions
- Cultural context references
- Level-appropriate language complexity

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

### A1 Level Example:
- "Do you work from home? Yes or No?"
- "Is remote work common in your country?"

### B1 Level Example:
- "What do you think about remote work trends in the UK?"
- "How is remote work different in your country compared to Britain?"

### C1 Level Example:
- "How do cultural attitudes toward work-life balance influence remote work adoption in the UK versus your country?"

The warm-up questions should now be contextual, level-appropriate, and preserved in the final lesson structure!
