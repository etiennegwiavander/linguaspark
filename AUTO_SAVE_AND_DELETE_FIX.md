# Auto-Save Lessons and Delete Functionality Fix

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Auto-Save Lessons on Generation
**File**: `app/popup/page.tsx`

Updated `handleLessonGenerated` to automatically save lessons to the database when they're generated:

- Uses the `/api/save-lesson` API route (bypasses hanging Supabase client)
- Gets auth token from localStorage
- Saves lesson automatically without user interaction
- Non-blocking: If save fails, lesson is still displayed and user can save manually later
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Key Features**:
- Automatic save after lesson generation completes
- Silent failure (doesn't block user with alerts)
- Logs errors to console for debugging
- User can still manually save via "Save to Library" button if auto-save fails

### 2. Fixed Delete Functionality
**Files**: 
- `app/api/delete-lesson/route.ts` (new)
- `components/lesson-library.tsx` (updated)

Created a dedicated API route for deleting lessons and updated the library to use it:

**API Route** (`/api/delete-lesson`):
- Accepts DELETE requests with lesson ID as query parameter
- Validates authentication via Authorization header
- Ensures user owns the lesson (via RLS policy)
- Returns success/error response

**Library Component**:
- Updated `handleDeleteLesson` to call the API route
- Gets auth token from localStorage
- Shows confirmation dialog before deleting
- Updates UI immediately after successful deletion
- Shows error alert if deletion fails

## How It Works

### Auto-Save Flow:
1. User generates a lesson
2. Lesson displays immediately
3. Background save to database starts automatically
4. If save succeeds: Lesson appears in library
5. If save fails: User can manually save later via button

### Delete Flow:
1. User clicks delete icon on lesson card
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. If confirmed, API call is made
4. Lesson is deleted from database (with RLS check)
5. Lesson is removed from UI
6. If error occurs, alert is shown

## Testing

### Test Auto-Save:
1. Generate a new lesson
2. Wait for generation to complete
3. Check console for: `âœ… Lesson saved to database with ID: ...`
4. Navigate to `/library`
5. Verify the lesson appears in the list

### Test Delete:
1. Go to `/library`
2. Click the trash icon on any lesson
3. Confirm the deletion dialog
4. Verify the lesson disappears from the list
5. Refresh the page to confirm it's deleted from database

## API Routes Created

### POST `/api/save-lesson`
- Saves a new lesson to the database
- Requires: Authorization header, lesson data in body
- Returns: Saved lesson object with ID

### DELETE `/api/delete-lesson?id=<lesson-id>`
- Deletes a lesson from the database
- Requires: Authorization header, lesson ID in query
- Returns: Success confirmation

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Lessons are automatically saved, no extra clicks needed
2. **Reliability**: Uses API routes that don't hang (unlike lessonService)
3. **Security**: All operations validate authentication and ownership
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and logging
5. **Non-Blocking**: Auto-save failures don't interrupt user workflow
