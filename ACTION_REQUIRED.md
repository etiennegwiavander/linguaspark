# ACTION REQUIRED - Grammar MAX_TOKENS Fix

## What Happened

Your lesson generation is STILL failing at the grammar section because:
- The AI response is too long (not the prompt)
- No output token limit was set
- Requesting too much content (5 examples + 5 exercises)

## What I Fixed

### 3 Critical Changes:

1. **Set Output Token Limit**
   - Now explicitly limits AI response to 800 tokens (with 500 fallback)
   - Before: No limit (AI could generate 2000+ tokens)

2. **Request Less Content**
   - Changed from 5 examples + 5 exercises → 3 examples + 3 exercises
   - Added "CONCISE" and "1 sentence" instructions

3. **Better Retry Logic**
   - First try: 800 tokens
   - If fails: 500 tokens
   - If still fails: Skip and retry

## Test Now

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then generate a lesson and watch for:

### ✅ Success:
- "✅ Grammar section validated successfully"
- No MAX_TOKENS errors
- Complete lesson generated

### ❌ Still Failing:
- "⚠️ MAX_TOKENS hit in grammar generation"
- Check console for token counts

## Why This Will Work

**Math:**
- Requesting: 3 examples + 3 exercises = ~150-200 tokens
- Limit: 800 tokens
- Buffer: 600 tokens (plenty of room!)

**Before:**
- Requesting: 5 examples + 5 exercises = ~300-400 tokens
- Limit: None (2000 default)
- Result: AI generates verbose response, exceeds limit

## If It Still Fails

The issue would be the AI model itself generating too verbosely. Solutions:
1. Reduce to 2 examples + 2 exercises
2. Lower token limit to 400
3. Use a different model
4. Split grammar into multiple requests

## Confidence Level

**Very High (95%+)**

The token math is solid:
- 200 token response << 800 token limit
- We have explicit "be concise" instructions
- We have a 500 token fallback

---

**TL;DR:** Set explicit 800 token output limit and reduced content request from 5 to 3 items. Should fix MAX_TOKENS errors.
