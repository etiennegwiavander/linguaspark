British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has unexpectedly announced his resignation following a series of political setbacks. The departure of the Conservative leader has created significant uncertainty in UK politics. Sunak, who became Prime Minister in October 2022, faced mounting pressure from within his own party over economic policies and leadership decisions. His resignation marks a turbulent period in British political history, with questions now arising about who will lead the Conservative Party and the country forward. Political analysts suggest this unexpected move could trigger an early general election, though the timing remains unclear.
